#Coffee Sales Dashboard 

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing an interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The dashboard is designed to provide detailed insights into sales performance across various coffee types, regions, and customer segments. It allows users to explore the data dynamically and filter key metrics to generate actionable insights for better decision-making.

**Key Features:**
Total Sales Over Time: Displays a line chart that tracks the sales performance of different coffee types (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, Robusta) over time.
Sales by Country: Bar chart visualization showcasing the sales breakdown by key regions, including the United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.
Top 5 Customers: Lists the top 5 customers based on total sales volume and highlights their purchasing behavior.
Interactive Filters: The dashboard includes slicers for filtering data by roast type, coffee size, and loyalty card status, making the dashboard highly customizable for user-specific needs.

**Usage**
The dashboard is built in Excel and requires Excel 2016 or later for full functionality. Users can interact with various slicers and filters to customize the view of the data:

**Time Period:** Filter by specific months or years to see sales trends during selected timeframes.
**Roast Type:** Filter between dark, medium, and light roasts to see how each product category performs.
**Coffee Size:** View sales performance by different coffee package sizes (0.2 kg, 0.5 kg, 1.0 kg, 2.5 kg).
**Loyalty Card Status:** Filter between customers with and without loyalty cards to understand customer behavior based on loyalty programs.
